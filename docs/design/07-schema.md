# Data Schema Design

## Overview

Four data entities, described in a storage-agnostic format (no SQL DDL). Each entity maps to a table/collection in the chosen storage backend (DuckDB / PostgreSQL / ClickHouse).

```
agent_turns  ─── 1:N ───  llm_calls  ─── aggregated into ───  llm_metrics
                                                         ╲
                                                          ─── llm_finish_metrics
```

Per the project-wide read-path rule, cross-entity reads never use `JOIN` — `agent_turns` carries its child `call_ids` inline and detail reads issue a follow-up `IN (?, ?, ...)` lookup against `llm_calls`. Finish-reason counts live in their own long-format table (`llm_finish_metrics`) so the wide pre-aggregation table can keep a fixed column set.

---

## 1. `llm_calls` — Per-Request Detail

One record per LLM API call. The core fact table. Includes full request/response body content.

### Design Notes

- **Performance metrics in requests table**: `ttft_ms` and `e2e_latency_ms` are computed at write time for fast single-record queries. Per-call Token Throughput can be derived: `output_tokens / (complete_time - response_time)` (tokens/s).
- **Full body storage**: `request_body` and `response_body` store complete JSON. For streaming responses, `response_body` contains the concatenated final content.
- **Headers storage**: `request_headers` and `response_headers` store complete HTTP headers as JSON arrays of `[key, value]` pairs, preserving order and allowing duplicate keys. Rate limit info, request IDs, processing time, etc. can be queried from stored headers without top-level extraction.
- **`response_id`**: Wire API's response/message ID (e.g., OpenAI `chatcmpl-xxx`, Anthropic `msg_xxx`). Promoted to top-level for fast cross-referencing with vendor logs.

### `finish_reason` vocabulary

Raw provider value, verbatim. The owning row's `wire_api` determines which vocabulary applies:

| `wire_api` | Possible values |
|---|---|
| `anthropic` | `end_turn`, `stop_sequence`, `max_tokens`, `tool_use`, `pause_turn`, `refusal`, `model_context_window_exceeded` |
| `openai-chat` | `stop`, `length`, `tool_calls`, `function_call`, `content_filter` |
| `openai-responses` | `completed`, `incomplete`, `failed`, `cancelled` |

Future provider values flow through verbatim; no normalization is performed. The `WireApi::is_terminal(&str)` and `WireApi::is_tool_use(&str)` predicates encode wire-level semantics and are the canonical way to interpret these values in code — consumers (tracker, metrics, UI) MUST NOT hardcode comparisons against the strings above.

> **Migration note.** Rows written before the raw-string refactor (see `CHANGELOG`) carry the legacy normalized labels (`complete`, `length`, `tool_use`, `error`, `cancelled`). No reverse migration is performed; queries that mix old and new data must handle both. New rows always carry raw provider values, distinguishable by row date.

---

## 2. `agent_turns` — One Agent Interaction (1:N over `llm_calls`)

One record per agent turn (a contiguous sequence of `llm_calls` for a single agent run). Inline `call_ids` keeps cross-entity reads JOIN-free per the project-wide rule.

```
agent_turns
├── Primary Key
│   └── id: string (UUID v7, time-ordered, minted at finalize)
│
├── Identity & Association
│   ├── agent_kind: string            # e.g. anthropic / openai-codex / generic
│   ├── session_id: string?           # client-supplied session marker, when available
│   ├── source_id: u32                # capture source (matches llm_metrics.source_id)
│   └── call_ids: string[]            # ordered list of llm_calls.id in this turn
│
├── Timestamps
│   ├── start_time: timestamp         # first call's request_time
│   └── end_time: timestamp           # last call's complete_time (or finalize-time if incomplete)
│
├── Outcome
│   ├── status: string                # complete | incomplete (see below)
│   └── final_finish_reason: string?  # raw finish_reason of the call that closed the turn
│
└── Text
    ├── user_input_preview: string?
    └── final_answer_preview: string?

Indexes:
  - end_time
  - agent_kind, end_time
```

### Field notes

- **`status`** (`VARCHAR NOT NULL`) — Two values only: `complete` (a wire-level terminal landed before finalize) or `incomplete` (idle timeout, pcap EOF, server shutdown, or connection RST mid-stream). The wire-level reason — `end_turn`, `max_tokens`, `refusal`, etc. — lives in `final_finish_reason`. Older databases written when the column carried `length` / `failed` / `cancelled` are upgraded in place on init: `length → complete`, `failed`/`cancelled → incomplete`. The wire reason for those legacy rows is unrecoverable.
- **`final_finish_reason`** (`VARCHAR`, nullable) — Raw `finish_reason` of the call that closed this turn. Same vocabulary as `llm_calls.finish_reason` (per `wire_api`); same migration caveat for rows pre-dating the raw-string refactor.
- **`call_ids`** carries the ordered child UUIDs inline so detail reads can issue a single `SELECT ... FROM llm_calls WHERE id IN (?, ?, ...)` follow-up. See `query_turn_calls` in `ts-storage/src/duckdb.rs` for the canonical pattern. Storing this list inline is the project's chosen alternative to a relational JOIN.

---

## 3. `llm_metrics` — Pre-Aggregated Time-Series

Pre-aggregated metrics by time window + dimension combination. Frontend dashboards query this table exclusively for trend charts and overview panels — never the detail tables.

**Multi-row per key.** The aggregator drains each bucket on a fixed per-granularity cadence (see `05-metrics.md`). A fast response emits **one** row per `(timestamp, source_id, granularity, wire_api, model, server_ip)` key; a slow response whose Complete arrives after its bucket was already drained opens a fresh bucket for the same window and emits an **additional** row at the next cadence. The key is therefore a row-identity marker, **not** a unique primary key — queries always use `GROUP BY timestamp [+ dim]` with `SUM()` to collapse multiple slices into the window total. Every average-style field is stored as a `(sum, count)` pair to make this collapse exact.

```

### Design Notes

- **`source_id`**: Per-capture-source dimension so each source keeps an independent event-time watermark — without it, clock skew between sources (cloud-probe vs. local pcap) would re-open already-flushed windows and emit duplicate rows. Today `source_id` equals the 0-based index of the capture source in `[[capture.sources]]`; the pipeline-to-source mapping may decouple later (e.g. fan-out or merged sources), so API/frontend treat `source_id` as internal and never filter on it.
- **Query-time aggregation.** Rows that share `(timestamp, granularity, wire_api, model, server_ip)` — whether they differ by `source_id` or are multiple drain slices of the same source — are merged by `GROUP BY timestamp [+ dim]`:
  - Plain counters / totals → `SUM()`.
  - Averages → `SUM(*_sum) / SUM(*_count)` (exact).
  - `active_calls_max` → `MAX()`.
  - Percentiles → `SUM(*_p* * *_count) / SUM(*_count)` (approximation — weighting by the matching `*_count` keeps slow-response rows with `call_count=0` from collapsing the result to zero, but it is not equivalent to merging the underlying t-digests. Serialized t-digest bytes is the planned long-term fix.)
- **Aggregation levels**: finest `(wire_api, model, server_ip)` for drilldown, global `(*, *, *)` for overview. Additional dimensions will be added as they are validated with real traffic.
- **Other dimension analysis**: query `llm_calls` detail table with GROUP BY for dimensions not yet in pre-aggregation.
- **`*_sum / *_count` instead of `*_avg`**: averages are not additive across rows; storing the exact sum and count lets the query layer SUM over any set of rows (multi-source, multi-drain-slice) and divide to get a correct average. The per-row percentiles (`*_p*`) are t-digest estimates over that row's slice only — single-row views can read them directly.
- **Multi-granularity**: Fine-grained (10s) for realtime dashboards, coarse (1h) for historical trends. Each granularity has its own drain cadence equal to its window size, so steady-state row count per granularity matches the number of windows covered.
- **Active Calls**: Per-`DimensionKey` counter (+1 on `Start`, -1 on `Complete`); every Start writes the current value as a sample into `active_calls_sum / active_calls_sample_count` and updates `active_calls_max`. Cross-row avg via the `sum / count` pair; peak via `MAX(active_calls_max)`.
- **Derivable metrics** (computed at query time, not stored): Call Rate (`call_count / window_seconds`), Call Success Rate (`1 - error_count / call_count`), Token Throughput in tokens/s (`total_output_tokens / window_seconds`), Cache Hit Ratio (`total_cache_read_input_tokens / total_input_tokens`).

## 4. `llm_finish_metrics` — Long-Format Finish-Reason Counts

Per-bucket counts of `finish_reason` occurrences. Long-format because the value space is unbounded (raw provider values, future-extensible per provider). Splitting this out of `llm_metrics` keeps the wide table's column set fixed while letting finish-reason cardinality grow.

```
llm_finish_metrics
├── Row Key (composite; same multi-row caveat as llm_metrics)
│   ├── timestamp: timestamp         # Bucket start
│   ├── source_id: string            # Capture source ('*' for rolled-up tier)
│   ├── granularity: string          # 10s / 1m / 5m / 1h
│   ├── wire_api: string             # '*' = all
│   ├── model: string                # '*' = all
│   ├── server_ip: string            # always '*' (no per-server tier)
│   └── finish_reason: string        # raw provider value
│
└── Counter
    └── count: u64                   # calls in this bucket with this finish_reason

Indexes:
  - timestamp, granularity
```

### Design Notes

- **No JOIN on read.** Readers query `llm_finish_metrics` directly via the `/api/metrics/finish-reasons` endpoint; nothing in the read path joins it back to `llm_metrics`. Splitting the table does not introduce a JOIN — it only narrows each row.
- **Dimension tiers.** The aggregator emits up to four tiers per bucket: `(W, M, S)`, `(W, M, *)`, `(*, *, S)`, `(*, *, *)`. Reads pick the matching tier based on the request's filter shape; `wire_api` / `model` filters with multiple values use SQL `IN` to OR within a tier.
- **Vocabulary.** `finish_reason` carries the same raw provider values listed in section 1. The `wire_api` column distinguishes which vocabulary the value belongs to; for the `(*, *, *)` rolled-up tier the `wire_api` column is `*` and the underlying values may be from any provider — readers that need per-provider breakdowns must request a `(W, ...)` tier explicitly.
- **Multi-row per key.** Same drain-cadence semantics as `llm_metrics`: late completes can produce additional rows for an already-drained window. Queries always use `GROUP BY ... finish_reason` with `SUM(count)` to collapse.

---

## Data Lifecycle

Retention is **disabled by default**; operators opt in via `[storage.retention]` in config. Once enabled, a background sweeper (spawned at startup, cancelled on Ctrl+C) runs every `check_interval_secs` (default 3600) and deletes rows older than the per-table / per-granularity cutoff. A value of `0` (or a field absent) means "never expire" for that table/granularity.

**Cutoff columns** (what "old" means):
- `llm_calls.request_time`
- `agent_turns.end_time` (NOT NULL; turn completion — safer than start_time)
- `llm_metrics.timestamp`, further keyed by `granularity`
- `llm_finish_metrics.timestamp`, further keyed by `granularity` (sweeper reuses the `llm_metrics` per-granularity cutoffs)

**Recommended defaults** (set explicitly in config; no built-in defaults to avoid surprise deletion):

```toml
[storage.retention]
enabled = true
check_interval_secs = 3600
calls = 7     # llm_calls max age in days
turns = 30    # agent_turns max age in days

[storage.retention.metrics]
"10s" = 1
"1m"  = 7
"5m"  = 30
"1h"  = 365
```

Each backend implements `StorageBackend::apply_retention` with a dialect-appropriate strategy:
- **DuckDB** (current): per-table DELETE + `CHECKPOINT` once per sweep to reclaim on-disk space (DuckDB DELETEs are MVCC tombstones until checkpoint).
- **PostgreSQL** (planned): simple DELETE, or declarative partitioning + `DROP TABLE partition`; with TimescaleDB, `drop_chunks`.
- **ClickHouse** (planned): declarative `TTL ... INTERVAL N DAY` on the MergeTree at init; `apply_retention` degrades to `OPTIMIZE TABLE ... FINAL` or a no-op.

## Upgrade Notes

### `AgentTurn` rename (`LlmTurn` → `AgentTurn`)

- Table `llm_turns` → `agent_turns`
- Column `client_kind` → `agent_kind`

No online migration is performed. Existing `server/data/tokenscope.duckdb` files from before the rename should be deleted before restart — the backend will recreate the new schema on first run via `CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS`.

### `finish_reason` raw-string refactor (see `CHANGELOG`)

Idempotent on-init migrations on the DuckDB backend:

- `llm_metrics`: `ALTER TABLE ... DROP COLUMN IF EXISTS finish_complete_count` (and the four sibling columns: `finish_length_count`, `finish_tool_use_count`, `finish_error_count`, `finish_cancelled_count`).
- `agent_turns`: one-time `UPDATE agent_turns SET status='complete' WHERE status='length'` and `UPDATE agent_turns SET status='incomplete' WHERE status IN ('failed','cancelled')`. After this update the legacy `length` / `failed` / `cancelled` values cannot reappear; the wire reason for those rows is unrecoverable.
- `llm_calls.finish_reason` is **not** rewritten. Pre-refactor rows keep their normalized labels (`complete`, `length`, `tool_use`, `error`, `cancelled`); post-refactor rows carry raw provider values. The two are distinguishable by row date. Application code that filters or groups across the boundary must handle both vocabularies.
- `llm_finish_metrics` is created via `CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS` on first run; no historical backfill from the old `finish_*_count` columns is performed.
